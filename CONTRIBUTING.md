# Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but but before submitting new features or examples [open an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/opentelemetry-examples/issues/new) and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make. After a resolution is reached a PR can be submitted for review.

## Pull requests

When submitting a pull request, take into account the following guidelines:

- Ensure your contribution is properly tested.
- Open your PR against the `main` branch.
- Include documentation for running/building/deploying if adding a new example.
